# Gamma-QCIP
Data set used in “On interdicting dense clusters in a network” paper. It contains 20 randomly-generated networks and 38 real-life networks. Each file contains 1+X+Y lines, where X and Y are the number of vertices and the number of edges in the network, respectively. It starts with two numbers indicating the number of vertices X and the number of edges Y. Then, it follows X lines of two numbers. Note that we do not assign index to each vertex. The index of is defaultly assigned as the order of the vertex appearing in X lines.The first number in each line is the weight of a vertex and the second number is the blocking cost. The last Y lines contain three numbers. The first and second number in each line are the head and tail of an edge. Note that the edge is undirected. The third number is the blcking cost of the edge.
