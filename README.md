# Gamma-QCIP
Data set used in “On interdicting dense clusters in a network” paper. It contains 20 randomly-generated networks and 38 real-life networks. Each file contains 1+X+Y lines, where X and Y are the number of vertices and the number of edges in the network, respectively. It starts with two numbers indicating the number of vertices X and the number of edges Y. Then, it follows X lines of two numbers. Each line indicates the weight and blocking cost of a vertex. Then, it follows Y lines of three numbers. Each line indicates the head and tail of an edge and the blcking cost of the edge. Note that the edge is undirected. The index of head and tail is the order of the vertex showing in X lines.
